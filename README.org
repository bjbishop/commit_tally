* Git commit tally

This is a [[http://pre-commit.com/][pre-commit]] hook that only add's a period <.> character to a
date stamped file. This is to keep track of how many commits have been
performed by day for a simple personal productivity metric.


* Reporting

With a shell command using `find` and `wc` to produce a report:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  find tally -type f -exec wc -c {} \\;
#+END_SRC

which produces output like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       3 tally/2015/09/2015-09-25
       8 tally/2015/09/2015-09-28
      13 tally/2015/09/2015-09-29
      10 tally/2015/09/2015-09-30
       6 tally/2015/10/2015-10-01
       7 tally/2015/10/2015-10-02
      11 tally/2015/10/2015-10-05
       3 tally/2015/10/2015-10-06
      12 tally/2015/10/2015-10-07
